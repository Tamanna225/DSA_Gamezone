# DSA_Gamezone
This project is a collection of interactive visualizers and games that showcase fundamental data structures and algorithms in a fun and engaging way. The repository includes the following games:


**N-Queens Visualizer**
A visualization of the classic N-Queens problem, demonstrating the backtracking algorithm. Users can place queens on the board and visualize the algorithm checking for conflicts. The game features:

Manual placement of queens.
Visualization of the backtracking algorithm.
Highlighting of problematic cells.
A 'Check' button to validate the current board state.


**BST Visualizer**
An interactive Binary Search Tree (BST) visualizer that allows users to:

Insert nodes one by one into the BST.
Select nodes by clicking on them.
Delete selected nodes with animations showing the BST reconfiguration after removal.


**Tic Tac Toe**
An engaging implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game where users can:

Play against the computer.
Experience an intuitive and responsive design.


#Tower of Hanoi
A visual representation of the Tower of Hanoi problem, illustrating the recursive solution. Users can:

Move disks between rods to solve the puzzle.
Watch the solution process step-by-step with animations.
